## Authentication

### Admin Login

- Admins use OTP login (same as users)
- Admin email is set in `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable
- Admin receives OTP via email to login
- Only admin can create new users

### User Login

- Users enter the OTP to login

## Financial System

### Weekly Investment System

- Each user invests a set amount every week (e.g., Rs 100)

### Loan Repayment System

- Loan amount accumulates simple interest at 1% per week
- Users must pay back the principal loan amount plus interest in 10 weeks
- Interest payment is made weekly along with the loan amount
- Total payable weekly = weekly principal + 1% interest on remaining balance
